This is my fork of @robertmeta's theme. All I've changed to date is a few
tweaks to the `nofrils-light` theme to match my personal preferences.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is an extremely minimalist vim colorscheme (almost no syntax highlighting).

To use:
- :colo nofrils-dark
- :colo nofrils-sepia
- :colo nofrils-light
- :let g:nofrils_strbackgrounds=1 to turn highlighted string backgrounds

The only highlighted elements are spelling, errors, comments, vim features and *optionally* string backgrounds

Sepia, dark and light screenshot of the colorscheme with **:let g:nofrils_strbackgrounds=1** (with this off, the default, background of strings is same as normal background).  The pink(ish) highlight is for misspellings.
